# ShopifyChallenge
I used  multiple libraries for this challenge

1. Retrofit for the http calls to make it easier
2. Moshi to map the http response to my objects
3. Glide to load the pictures over http
4. EasyFlipView for a nice UI effect
5. MaterialDialog for compliance with material design as much as i could!
